For advanced developers, FullCalendar provides an API for building custom views with the unlimited flexibility of JavaScript code.<!--more--> Using [OOP programming principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), one can *subclass* the base `View` class, implementing or overriding each specific behavior as a *method*, and then *registering* the new class with FullCalendar, like so:

```js
var FC = $.fullCalendar; // a reference to FullCalendar's root namespace
var View = FC.View;      // the class that all views must inherit from
var CustomView;          // our subclass

CustomView = View.extend({ // make a subclass of View

  initialize: function() {
    // called once when the view is instantiated, when the user switches to the view.
    // initialize member variables or do other setup tasks.
  },

  render: function() {
    // responsible for displaying the skeleton of the view within the already-defined
    // this.el, a jQuery element.
  },

  setHeight: function(height, isAuto) {
    // responsible for adjusting the pixel-height of the view. if isAuto is true, the
    // view may be its natural height, and `height` becomes merely a suggestion.
  },

  renderEvents: function(events) {
    // reponsible for rendering the given Event Objects
  },

  destroyEvents: function() {
    // responsible for undoing everything in renderEvents
  },

  renderSelection: function(range) {
    // accepts a {start,end} object made of Moments, and must render the selection
  },

  destroySelection: function() {
    // responsible for undoing everything in renderSelection
  }

});

FC.views.custom = CustomView; // register our class with the view system
```

The View class provides many other methods that can be overridden or leveraged. See the [View class' source](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/blob/master/src/View.ts) for more insight. It might be wise to *watch* the project on GitHub in case the API for any of the more advanced non-standard methods changes.

When overriding an advanced method, it is always a good idea to call its super-method, the method that the View super-class defines:

```js
CustomView = View.extend({

  // clears the view's rendering and executes other cleanup tasks
  destroy: function() {

    // <your custom cleanup-code here>

    // call the super-class's method, forwarding all arguments
    View.prototype.destroy.apply(this, arguments);
  }

});
```

The above documentation is helpful for building a barebones view, but making it full-featured and interactive is a further challenging. A robust view should be right-to-left compatible, locale-customizable, allow event dragging and resizing, allow user selections, and more...

Making a full-featured view is beyond the scope of this document. Further documentation should be written and further APIs should be formalized, but for now, it would be best to browse FullCalendar's [source on GitHub]({{ site.fullcalendar_repo }}). Pay attention to how [BasicView](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/blob/master/src/basic/BasicView.ts) and [AgendaView](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/blob/master/src/agenda/AgendaView.ts) are implemented.
